=== WP Job Manager - Public API ===
Contributors: judgej
Requires at least: 4.4
Tested up to: 4.8.2
Stable tag: 1.1.2
License: GNU General Public License v3.0

Until the WP Job Manager fully supports the WP REST APi, this will expose titles and permalinks to the REST API.

= Documentation =

This plugin offers no configuration or administration pages. It just does what it does.
I expect and hope the need for plugin will be redundant in time, as WP Job Manager starts to
support these capabilities, i.e. offers guest access to jobs that are accessible as guests
at the front end.

This plugin requires at least PHP 5.4

Note: from version 1.1.2 for all endpoints, the path part "job" and "jobs" is synonymous; you can use either.
Version 1.1.1 used a mix of the two, for multiple and single job fetching.
This change was introduced for consistency, but in a backward-compatible way.

A single job detail can be found at the endpoint:

    https://example.com/wp-json/wpjm_public/v1/jobs/{job_id}

e.g. https://example.com/wp-json/wpjm_public/v1/jobs/2567

```
"2567": {
    "post_id": 41129,
    "post_title": "Strategic Manager â€“ Homelessness, Allocations and Voids Property Management",
    "post_name": "strategic-manager-homelessness-allocations-voids-property-management",
    "post_type": "job_listing",
    "permalink": "https://example.com/job/strategic-manager-homelessness-allocations-voids-property-management/",
    "post_date_gmt": "2017-06-21 11:34:37",
    "post_status": "publish",
    "guid": "https://example.com/?post_type=job_listing&#038;p=41878",
    "application_deadline_date": "2017-04-27",
    "listing_expiry_date": "2017-04-27"
}
```

Listings of jobs can be derived from the following endpoints:

*  https://example.com/wp-json/wpjm_public/v1/jobs
*  https://example.com/wp-json/wpjm_public/v1/jobs/{date-from}
*  https://example.com/wp-json/wpjm_public/v1/jobs/{date-from}/{date-to}

The dates can be a year, year and month, or a full date: 2017, 2017-05, 2017-06-30
